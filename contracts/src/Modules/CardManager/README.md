# Card Manager Safe Module

## Overview

The Card Manager Safe Module is a powerful and flexible system for managing digital cards as Safe contracts. It provides functionality for creating instances, generating cards, managing whitelists, and controlling withdrawals.

## Key Features

1. **Instance Creation**: Create and manage separate instances within the Card Manager.

2. **Card Creation**: Generate new cards (implemented as Safe contracts) for instances using the hash of their serial numbers.

3. **Whitelist Management**: Maintain a whitelist of accounts for each instance, controlling access to card operations.

4. **Controlled Withdrawals**: Allow whitelisted accounts to withdraw from cards associated with their instance.

5. **Token Authorization**: Restrict withdrawals to only authorized tokens for each instance.

## Main Functions

- `createInstance(bytes32 id)`: Create a new instance with a unique identifier.
- `createCard(bytes32 id, bytes32 hashedSerial)`: Generate a new card (Safe) for a given instance and hashed serial number.
- `addToWhitelist(bytes32 id, address account)`: Add an account to the whitelist for a specific instance.
- `removeFromWhitelist(bytes32 id, address account)`: Remove an account from the whitelist of an instance.
- `authorizeToken(bytes32 id, address token)`: Authorize a token for withdrawals in a specific instance.
- `withdraw(bytes32 id, bytes32 hashedSerial, IERC20 token, address to, uint256 amount)`: Allow whitelisted accounts to withdraw authorized tokens from cards.

## Security Considerations

- Only instance owners can modify whitelists and authorize tokens.
- Withdrawals are restricted to whitelisted accounts and authorized tokens.
- Card creation uses secure hashing of serial numbers to ensure uniqueness.
- Serial numbers are never exposed, only their hashed values (bytes32) are used.
- Adding an existing card to an instance requires being authorized to do so.

## Usage

This module is designed to be integrated with Safe contracts, providing a robust system for managing digital cards with controlled access and operations.
